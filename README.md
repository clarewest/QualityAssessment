## Feature Gathering for Quality Assessment 

These are a collection of scripts I have been using to assess the quality of models output from SAINT2 structural prediction.

The directory structure is:
`$QA/data/DATASET/TARGET/MODELS`

Where DATASET is the name of a set of targets, and TARGET is a directory containing all the models for that target.

The following files are required in the data/DATASET directory: 
Many of these files are generated using the commands in $QA/bin/parallelize.sh 

TARGET/MODELS            : Ensure they all have a chain id. You can add the chain id "A" using the script:
                         - `$QA/bin/replace_chains.sh`

TARGET.fasta             : sequence file
TARGET.fasta.txt         : sequence file 
                           - NB this is a duplicate as difference software may require either format
TARGET.aln               : alignment file (from contact prediction using metaPSICOV)
TARGET.metapsicov.stage1 : metapsicov output (predicted contacts)
TARGET.fasta.ss2         : (for EigenTHREADER) psipred output file (predicted SS) - not the one used by metapsicov!
                           - see `$QA/bin/parallelize.sh`

TARGET.lst               : A list of model names
TARGET.pcons_lst         : A list of model names including the directory
TARGET.proq_lst          : A list of model names including directory and .pdb extension
                           - you can generate these using `$QA/bin/make_lsts.sh TARGET`

TARGET.con               : predicted contact file for use in SAINT2 scoring
config_TARGET file       : SAINT2 configuration file with scoring weights (ensure the paths are correct)


Run `get_features.sh` with the relevant arguments to calculate each stage.

## get_features.sh

Run with the flag `--help` to get help:

``` console 
$ bash get_features.sh --help

./get_features.sh [options] <NAME>

 Gather features for RFQAmodel

 Positional arguments:
 	-t | --target <NAME> 	prefix of the input files

 Optional arguments:
 	-h | --help		show this help text
 	-d | --dir		directory containing models (default: target)
 	-c | --chain		chain identifier of native structure (default: final character
 	-p | --ppv		calculate PPV of models
 	-m | --mapalign		run mapalign on models
 	-pe | --prepeigen	prepare files for EigenTHREADER
 	-s | --saint2		calculate SAINT2 score for all models (requires config file)
 	-e | --eigenthreader	run EigenTHREADER on models and gather scores
 	-p | --pcons		run Pcons for all models and gather scores
 	-q | --proq		run ProQ3D for all models and gather scores 
 	-m | --tmscore		calculate TM-score for all models
 	-l | --lddt		calculate lddt for all models
 	-b | --beff		calculate Beff for the target (requires TARGET.aln)
 	-ge | --gathereigen	gather EigenTHREADER scores from output files
 	-gp | --gatherpcons	gather Pcons scores from output files
 	-gq | --gatherproq	gather ProQ3D scores from output files
 	--scaffold <SEG> <TERM> flag as ScafFold and define segment length and terminal sampled
 	--gathersampled	gather ProQ3D, LDDT and PCons for sampled region only (requires --scaffold)


```


During the process, the following files will be created:

TARGET.out               : EigenTHREADER output
                           - note that model names must be added with $QA/bin/paste_eig_lst.sh
                             as they are truncated in the output of EigenTHREADER 

TARGET.pcons.txt         : Pcons output

Pcons, EigenTHREADER and Proq3D need to be run once on the ensemble of models. Run using:
$QA/bin/run_eigen.sh $TARGET $DATASET    : requires TDB_DIR directory and files generated using assess_quality.sh
$QA/bin/run_pcons                        : requires TARGET.pcons_lst
$QA/bin/runproq3d.sh                     : requires proq_lst
